# Lucia Nuño

My name is Lucia Nuño. I was born i Zamora, Michoacan and I'm very proud of it. 
I studied 3 years of Design until I realized that was not the carreer for me. 
After deciding to leave college, I went on a month long trip to Lisbon and a quick trip to Dublin. This left me with quite a considerable debt waiting for me when I came back. 
Finding myself with no money and a trip to pay, I decided to get a job as an ESL teacher. Little did I know this was one of theost fulfilling jobs I would ever have. 
Thanks to this job I started a seven year carreer path that finally led me to Technical Writing. 

Some of the roles I had before becoming a TW are:
 - ESL teacher
 - Teacher Trainer and Academic Coordinator
 - Training Development and Operations Lead
 - Project Manager
 - Major Incdent Manager

From all of them I learnt two important lessons:

 1. Never underestimate the power of a second language.
 2. Become your own teacher. Not everyone will want to share their knowledge with you.
